# Pig Game
Using my HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript knowledge, I built a simple Pig dice game.
Pig is a dice game in which players take turns to roll a single die as many times as they wish. They can adding all roll results to a running total, but they lose their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.
